# Simple Fishing [fishing]

Add simple multiplayer fishing, and seaplants.

It is just the fishing and sealife feature from the ethereal (not Ethereal NG [ethereal] mod):
<https://github.com/Echoes91/ethereal>.


## Differences in Poikilos fork
- The textures from the Xanthin zip are in git.
- The worm recipe and seaweed chance are changed to match ethereal.
- Green coral (coral5) from Echoes91/ethereal is present.
- Change the license to a correct upstream one (Chinchow's license was NOT GPL--TenPlus1 committed that then removed it later. Chinchow's license--see forum--said I could do whatever I want and I wanted to add a legally-sound license compatible with later upstream versions).
- See also: [changelog.md](changelog.md).


## Xanthin's notes

> - Ethereal by Chincow
> - Updated and maintained by TenPlus1
> - Extracted with small modifications by Xanthin
>
> If you want only fishing or only the seaplants, comment out the
> corresponding dofile in the init.lua file.
